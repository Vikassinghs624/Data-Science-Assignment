    "Answer: The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to design and structure software in a way that models real-world entities and their interactions by organizing code into objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- OOP promotes the following key principles and goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Abstraction: OOP allows you to abstract complex systems by representing them using objects and        classes. This means focusing on the essential characteristics and behavior of real-world entities \n",
    "     while hiding unnecessary details.\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and the methods\n",
    "     (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit called an object. This provides a way to\n",
    "     control access to the data and ensures that it is only modified through defined methods,\n",
    "     enhancing data security and maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "  3. Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows you to create new classes based on existing \n",
    "     classes, inheriting their attributes and behaviors. This promotes code reusability and the\n",
    "     creation of hierarchies of related objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "  4. Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a\n",
    "     common superclass. It enables you to write more flexible and generic code that can work with \n",
    "     different types of objects, promoting code extensibility and adaptability.\n",
    "\n",
    "  5. Modularity: OOP encourages breaking down a large, complex software system into smaller, more \n",
    "     manageable modules or classes. Each class should have a specific responsibility, making the code \n",
    "     easier to understand, test, and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "  6. Ease of Maintenance: OOP aims to make code more maintainable by organizing it into objects and\n",
    "     classes, reducing the complexity of understanding and modifying the software over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "  7. Code Reusability: By creating classes that can be reused in different parts of an application or\n",
    "     even in other projects, OOP helps save development time and promotes a more efficient software\n",
    "     development process.\n",
    "\n",
    "  8. Modeling Real-World Concepts: OOP allows developers to model real-world entities and their \n",
    "     relationships, which makes it easier to understand, communicate about, and develop software that \n",
    "     closely resembles the problem domain."
